(1) 
The Unit Cell parameters for oxidoreductase (RCSB 5DBQ)
(insect thioredoxin)
See (2)

Since a != b != c, alpha = gamma = 90 deg, and Beta != 90 deg;

the crystal lattice system for oxidoreductase is monoclinic.

The Unit Cell parameters for oxidoreductase:

a = 107.710
b = 28.980 
c = 79.860  
alpha = 90.00 
beta = 128.32 
gamma = 90.00 

(3)

The volume of the oxidoreductase unit cell is equal to 195573.43 cubic angstroms

  See:  unit_cell_volume.py

(4)

From the PDB file:  Matthews Coefficient, Vm (Angstroms**3/DA): 2.02

Molecular Weight esimtated from PDB:  24972.0
Vm = 2.02
Mass = volume / Vm

num_molecules = Mass / MW = 3.8  per assymmetric unit;

NOTE: Not clear to me how this is supposed to work.  I understand the definition of Vm, but
      not the means to get at the data.
